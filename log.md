# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 25th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Basic HTML and HTML5 on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Trying to get my head around all the jargon involved in development. Trying to understand anchor, elements and adding links which takes a while to understand. Also not good to start and stop, best to remember to commit a designated time to it each day moving forward as it can get confusing picking up from where you left off.
