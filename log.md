# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 25th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Basic HTML and HTML5 on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Trying to get my head around all the jargon involved in development. Trying to understand anchor, elements and adding links which takes a while to understand. Also not good to start and stop, best to remember to commit a designated time to it each day moving forward as it can get confusing picking up from where you left off. 

### Day 2: 26th July 2018

 **Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML and HTML5. Now Starting Basic CSS on FreeCodeCamp 
 
 **Thoughts:** Enjoying these challenges, taking a while to understand but better to try it rather than understand everything immediately.
 
 ### Day 3: 1st August 2018
 
 **Today's Progress**: Started back on CSS. Was away on holiday for a couple days
 
 **Thoughts:** Very frustrating evening as I was stuck on "Importing Google Fonts" - got stuck on one of the challenges stating I didn't have a H2 selector on. Had to do a lot of trial and error to finally get it to work. Clearly taking a holiday slows down progress and makes me rusty.
