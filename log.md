# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 25th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Basic HTML and HTML5 on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Trying to get my head around all the jargon involved in development. Trying to understand anchor, elements and adding links which takes a while to understand. Also not good to start and stop, best to remember to commit a designated time to it each day moving forward as it can get confusing picking up from where you left off. 

### Day 2: 26th July 2018

 **Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML and HTML5. Now Starting Basic CSS on FreeCodeCamp 
 
 **Thoughts:** Enjoying these challenges, taking a while to understand but better to try it rather than understand everything immediately.
 
 ### Day 3: 1st August 2018
 
 **Today's Progress**: Started back on CSS. Was away on holiday for a couple days
 
 **Thoughts:** Very frustrating evening as I was stuck on "Importing Google Fonts" - got stuck on one of the challenges stating I didn't have a H2 selector on. Had to do a lot of trial and error to finally get it to work. Clearly taking a holiday slows down progress and makes me rusty. 
 
 ### Day 4: 4th August 2018
 
 **Today's Progress**: Been recovering from an illness. Nearly finishing on CSS
 
 **Thoughts:** Been feeling ill the last couple of days so took some time off. Back on it and understanding margins, padding etc. Was on a roll until FreeCodeCamp went down for maintenance. Hoping to finish CSS by tomorrow/Monday. Have a wedding tomorrow so will be difficult to find time. 

### Day 5: 11th August 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic CSS on FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** Finding out that committing one hour a day is quite difficult and I need to be more proactive with it. Not managed to do it over the last couple of weeks which is bad. Will try and set an hour anytime in the day just to code. Really enjoyed learning Basic CSS. 

### Day 6: 18th August 2018

**Today's Progress**: Currently studying Visual Design.

**Thoughts:** Been working on Visual Design the last 2 days. Learning a lot about colors. Need to be more disciplined and regularly update Github and Twitter on my progress. 

### Day 7: 1st September 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Visual Design and now onto "Accessibility"

**Thoughts:** Finished Visual Design, really enjoyed this part of the curriculum. There was a lot to learn and clear that there are many ways to animate an object. Took a while to understand cubic-bezier but think I get it now. Will try and commit to an hour a day properly. 

### Day 8: 6th September 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on Applied Accessibility Challenges

**Thoughts:** Quite an interesting curriculum. Having spent some time doing CSS and Visual Design and then understanding semantics with Accessibility was cool. Starting to understand everything a bit better now and seeing how everything fits.
