### Day 1: 25th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Basic HTML and HTML5 on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Trying to get my head around all the jargon involved in development. Trying to understand anchor, elements and adding links which takes a while to understand. Also not good to start and stop, best to remember to commit a designated time to it each day moving forward as it can get confusing picking up from where you left off.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
